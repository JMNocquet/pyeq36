PYEQ: full time-dependent slip inversion
========================================

PYEQ allows full time-dependent slip inversion from GNSS time series.

Approach
--------

PYEQ models increment slip so that, at a given date, the sum of past increment slip multiplied by the Green functions equals the displacement given by the time series.


Main features
-------------
* variable model time step
* variable regularization constraints
